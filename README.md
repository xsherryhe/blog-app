This project is a very simple blog app built using Ruby on Rails. It follows the tutorial at [Ruby on Rails Guides: Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) sequentially section by section.

The project demonstrates common commands and basic functionality for the Rails framework, including routing, the model-view-controller (MVC) system, and basic creation and manipulation of controllers and views.

This project is currently in progress.
